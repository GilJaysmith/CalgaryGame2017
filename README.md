I'm writing a game based on the "CPSC 585 - Video Game Programming" course I co-taught at UCalgary at the start of January. The students have to do this so I figured I'd give it a shot too.

The game must demonstrate "driving" and "AI controlled vehicles". Beyond that it's up to the students.

My game is based on using open data for cities to create large-scale environments in which you and the AI drive between dynamically-generated checkpoints.

Whether this will be fun I don't yet know, but it's all proving very educational as I teach myself OpenGL rendering, PhysX, pathfinding, and all the other skills you need to actually make an entire game.

So that's what it is, and we'll see how it proceeds won't we?
